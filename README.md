# Complete Legend of Zelda Playthrough
This is a playthrough of every canonical Legend of Zelda game I'm doing with my best friend. Somehow, she's willing to put up with my nerdy obsession with git repos and file history(You're the best, girl! ❤️). We're playing the games in an order corresponding to the official Legend of Zelda history.

(TODO: Add link to or graphic of official timeline. See: [Japanese LoZ history](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/character/zelda/history/index.html)(notice BOTW separate at end of timeline), [unofficial LoZ history explanation on YouTube](https://youtu.be/gSFIe4E_Bl4), and Hyrule Historia)

I commit the changes to every binary save file changed after each play session. If you're interested, most game saves should be compatible with emulators, and you can find installation instructions inside each game folder's README(NOTE: No game ROMs will be included in this repo, only the save files). Additionally, because of the nature of git as a version control system, any version of any save file previously commited may be checked out.
